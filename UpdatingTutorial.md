This tutorial is generated using the Matlab [publish](http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/publish.html) command. As such the html files should not be modified directly, as these changes will be overwritten if the tutorial is republished. Instead, authorized users should follow these steps.

  * See this important note on [svn mime types](http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/svnMimeTypes).


  * Checkout a local copy of the tutorial from the [svn repository](http://code.google.com/p/yagtom/source/checkout).


  * Make the desired modifications to the .m files in the [source subdirectory](http://yagtom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/source/). There is one file per 'chapter'. See [this page](http://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2006/06/07/publishing/) for some markup tips, or type `doc publish` in Matlab.


  * Change to the yagtom root directory in Matlab and type `publishSource foo` where foo is the name the Matlab file you modified. Typing `publishSource` alone republishes all of the files in the source directory.


  * Check in the changes.


The [root wiki page](http://code.google.com/p/yagtom/) is not auto-generated. If you add or remove chapters, this will have to be manually updated.
